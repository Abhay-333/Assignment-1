# **Assignment 1 **

## **Project Description**

**Assignment 1** is a React-based application that displays a list of cat breeds fetched from an external API. The app showcases various cat breeds in a card layout, providing details such as the cat's name, origin, temperament, and lifespan. This Project also includes RandomUser, Random Joke and Navbar to navigate through those components. I have failed to make the catlist ui it is not appropriate, I am running out of time that's why i am submiting this project as incomplete, sorry for inconvinice, My Apologies. 


- **Horizontal Scrolling:** The cat list is horizontally scrollable, providing an easy way to browse through multiple breeds.
- **Dynamic Data Fetching:** The application fetches cat breed data from a third-party API and displays it dynamically.

## **Technologies Used**

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the components.
- **Fetch API:** Used for making HTTP requests to the third-party API to retrieve cat data.
